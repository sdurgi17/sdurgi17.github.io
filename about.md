Hi there,

I am Srikar Durgi; Software Nerd, inquisitive mind, lover of majestic things. This is where I would be sharing my thoughts about various topics of my interest which include Software Engineering, Technology, Nature (I love galaxies and big mountains), physics (I watch physics lectures which I don't fully understand). That's me! Thanks for stopping by.
