I am breaking the process into two parts, the inertia stage and the flow stage.
The inertia stage is where you know that the task at hand is important but you don't find yourself motivated enough to get started with it.
The barrier stage is where you have started working on the task but held up because there is something that you are unable to solve/contemplate/imagine.

## The inertia stage.
Whenever you want learn/do something new, you have great inertia that is stopping you from actually doing it. You are kinda waiting for the perfect moment and perfect inspiration. But the truth is there is no perfect moment, there is no magical messenger that's gonna tell you *"everything is in place .. you can start working now"*. The perfect moment is always now. Just start working on the thing that you think is important. There might be days where you actually can hear the calling, you get incredible motivation to work on the thing. Consider these days as bonus points, but don't wait for them. 

 ### Hack that might work.
- Say you have got a task that's going to take few days to complete, but you are struck in the procrastination loop. (I don't feel like doing it, I would rather scroll through fb/instagram) The trick is promise yourself that you'll work on it for 5 minutes. Don't think about real scale of the task. This greatly decreases the inertia and helps you get started with the task. Once started you end up spending much more time on the task than you promised yourself.

## The barrier stage (Embracing it)
So you have started working on the subject you are trying to learn and now encountered a barrier. The barrier can come in many forms depending on the what you are working on.
It might be a note you are trying to master in piano. It might be an equation in a long physics derivation. It might be a step in a computer algorithm. It might be a segmentation fault in your code. It might be a derivative of a loss function in a neural network (Well .. this happened with me). It might be a concept that you are unable to wrap your head around. All barriers have some innate property. These barriers tire people, they might make you feel that you are not worthy of the task, or probably you don't have what it takes to learn it. These barriers are the reason why most people give up on learning new tasks. So how to overcome the barrier ? "Embrace it". No, really !
Lets try to understand the nature of the barrier. What does the barrier want you to do ?
It wants you to do something you've not done before, think in a different way, imagine in a new direction, think in a lateral way. Afterall barrier doesn't seem so bad.. It wants you to learn something new !! Barriers are the ones which drive you away from learning something new paradoxically they are the points where actual learning happens. Next time you encounter a barrier, embrace it. Consider it as an opportunity to actually learn something. Once you have freed your mind from all the negative emotions (which you won't have if you embrace the barrier)  you get to concentrate on the actual problem in hand and go step further towards mastery.(You'll also get a dopamine shot as a bonus once you cross the barrier)
