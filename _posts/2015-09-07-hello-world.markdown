So finally I created my own blog/site.
After pondering over various options AWS, Dreamhost.. etc. 
I finally settled for github pages deployed on jekyll servers. I think this is a great option for starters (it's free, includes autodeployment, you can select from a great variety of jekyll themes freely available). After going through [various themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) I selected [daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io/). It's elegant also has disqus comment plugin, google analytics tracking integration built in. So thanks to [kronik3r](https://github.com/kronik3r).
