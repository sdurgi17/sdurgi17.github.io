So finally I created my own blog/site.
After pondering over various options AWS, Dreamhost.. etc. 
I finally settled for github pages using jekyll and a domain from godaddy. I think this is a great option for starters (it's free, includes autodeployment, you can select from a great variety of jekyll themes freely available). After going through [various themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) I selected [daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io/)(thanks to [kronik3r](https://github.com/kronik3r)). It's elegant also has disqus comment plugin, google analytics tracking integration built in.

These resources will be helpful for creating a site like this one.
