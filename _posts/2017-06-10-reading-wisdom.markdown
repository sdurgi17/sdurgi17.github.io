Say you've decided to become a voracious book reader. Read a ton of great books fiction/non-fiction anything and expand your knowledge and wisdom through them. And you picked one book, lets say its a bestseller with stellar rating with reviews like "Incredible life changing", "The best book I've ever read" and so on. So now you are fuelled with energy to get a new thoughtful perspective, probably change your life like the others who read it. Finally you started reading it, completed a chapter you kinda connect with the author understand what he is talking about. Few chapters in, you are bored, you are struck and are unable to move ahead.

It's neither your mistake nor of the author, let's just say books are like people. sometimes you get along and sometimes you don't.  Do try to get along with the book, probably skip a few pages, take a little break and come back to it. But the key is not to feel any guilt for not liking a popular book or unable to find it interesting. Afterall people have different interests and opinions some match and some don't.
There are a lot of books that are waiting to be read by you. Tons of knowledge, wisdom, magic worlds, colorful experiences waiting for you. Don't  let one book ruin that for you. 
You can always get back to the book you didn't finish.
